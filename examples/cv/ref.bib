  abstract  = {The bounded inverse power (BIP) interaction pair potential, $\phi$(r) = 1(a q + r q) nq , where a and the exponent, n, are constants which control the interaction softness, q is a positive integer, and r is the pair separation, is shown to exhibit isomorphic scaling as does the well-known inverse power potential, i.e., where a = 0. If T is the temperature and $\rho$ is the number density of particles, two state points are isomorphic if a reference state, $\rho$ 0 , T 0 , a 0 and another state, $\rho$, T, a are related through the relationships $\rho$ n3 T = $\rho$ n3 0 T 0 and a = a 0 ($\rho$ 0 $\rho$) 13 = a 0 (T 0 T) 1n. The potential form is therefore density dependent along an isomorph. Molecular dynamics simulations and solutions of the Ornstein-Zernike integral equation for q = 2 demonstrate the existence of isosbestic points (IBPs) in the radial distribution function and structure factor for 6 ≤ n ≤ 18 and a wide range of a and $\rho$ values. For the BIP potentials with not too small a values and over a wide density range, the IBP distance is insensitive to the number density and is equal to the distance, r T , defined through (r T) = T. For exponential potentials of the general form, (r) = C exp(−r m) with 1 ≤ m ≤ 3, there are also IBPs which are at r values that are typically ∼10-15{\%} larger than predicted by the formula for r T.

  abstract  = {This paper tests the performance gain of performing load balancing with angular adaptivity, that has been discretised using Haar wavelets. Load balancing on highly refined angular meshes resulted into a reduction in the runtime of approximately 50{\%} on a local machine. The time spent load balancing was found to be proportional to the number of unknowns of the problem, with the rate of the proportionality being dependant on the number of processing cores used. Strong scaling performance of 97{\%} was achieved in 240 cores, dropping to 50{\%} for 480 cores, for a mesh of 405,000 triangular elements. The ratio of nodes to halos indicates that as we adaptively refine, the load balancing algorithm produces an increasing number of partitions with fewer nodes and larger halos. Hence, destroying parallel scaling by performing communications instead of a solving the linear system.},
